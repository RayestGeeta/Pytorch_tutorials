# I have coming!. #

## 0.Basic understanding.
>### This part I will use some easy examples to use tensor and autograd.Then I will create a netural network.
***
## 1. Tensor
>### I will introduce Tensor in detail. It mainly includes :
>* #### Basic operations
>* #### Tensor and numpy
>* #### Internal structure
>* #### Other topics
***
## 2.Autograd
> 
> * ### At first,this is a picture about autograd calculate picture.You can have an intuitive understand from it.

>### At this part,I will introduce autograd from these aspects:
> * #### Variable's basic operation
> * #### how it works by calculate picture.
> * #### autograd extension(unimportant)
***
## 3.Netual network layers
